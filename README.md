# SocketPhoneClient
Very simple sockets client for Android, meant to be used with my [Socket Phone Server](https://github.com/dburgosp/SocketPhoneServer).

The IP and port values of the server are typed in two EditTexts. There is a single button for connecting the client to the server and get server radio data. These data is retrieved in a JSON document (defined in this [README.MD](https://github.com/dburgosp/SocketPhoneServer/blob/master/README.md) file) and the client parses it to display server radio data in an intelligible format.
